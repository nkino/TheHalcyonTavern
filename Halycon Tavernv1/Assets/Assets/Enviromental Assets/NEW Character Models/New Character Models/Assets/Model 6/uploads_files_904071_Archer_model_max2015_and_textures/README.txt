Low-poly model character made in 3ds max 2015.
It can be used in game engines, in creating a scene composition, 
in movies, in a render. To use the model, drag it to the desired 
program or open the model through the menu.

The model has a skeleton that is a trial animation.

The model in the formats OBJ, FBX does not have a skeleton, 
they only have geometry, since the format does not support this function.

All good work! Thank you!
